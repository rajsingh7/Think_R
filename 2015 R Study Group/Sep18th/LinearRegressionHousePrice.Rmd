## Remind of basic ML procedure
![BasicProcedure](BasicProcedure.jpg)

## Input data/Training Set
```{r}
houseData <- read.csv("Data.csv")
head(houseData)
```

## Linear Regression Model (A Family of models, H)
+ Independent variable expressed as a linear combination of dependent varibales
+ $y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + ... + w_kx_k$
+ let $x_0 = 1$ and rewrite the above formula
+ $y = w_0x_0 + w_1x_1 + ... + w_kx_k$
+ that is ${\bf y}  = {\bf w}^T{\bf x}$
+ different ${\bf w} \implies$ different model(h) in the family($H$)

## How to determine good model or bad model?
+ Commonly, want a model(h) that minimizes MSE of insample predictions
+ $MSE = \frac{1}{n-k-1}\Sigma{(y^{(i)} - \hat{y^{(i)}})^2}$
+ where $\hat{y^{(i)}} = {\bf w}^T{x^{(i)}}$
+ So the problem, stated in optimization term is:
+ $$\min_{{\bf w}} MSE = \frac{1}{n-k-1}\Sigma{(y^{(i)} - {\bf w}^T{x^{(i)}})^2}\\ s.t. nothing \qquad really...$$

## Sounds complicated....But
+ in R, it is as simple as
```{r}
h <- lm(formula = Price ~ Sq.Feet + Beds + Baths,
        data = houseData)
```
+ and we got the h now.
+ We will talk about how this is solved in futhure.

## So... agin how good is the model?
+ For now, let's only judge the model with the data we have in hand
+ look for the Adjusted R-squared value
```{r}
summary(h)
```

## What else we can do for now?
```{r}
h2 <- lm(formula = Price ~ Sq.Feet + Baths,
         data = houseData)
summary(h2)
```

## What else we can do for now?
```{r}
h3 <- lm(formula = Price ~ Sq.Feet,
         data = houseData)
summary(h3)
```

## What else we can do for now?
```{r}
h4 <- lm(formula = Price ~ Sq.Feet + Beds * Baths,
         data = houseData)
summary(h4)
```

## Try yourself, We can discuss next time
+ How good can you get?
+ And ... is this "good" guaranteed for outside data? 


data <- houseData
data$IT1 <- data$Beds/data$Sq.Feet
data$IT2 <- data$Baths/data$Sq.Feet
data$IT3 <- data$Beds*data$Baths
data$IT4 <- data$Beds*data$Baths/data$Sq.Feet
data$IT5 <- data$Sq.Feet^2
data$Beds <- as.factor(as.character(data$Beds))
data$Baths <- as.factor(as.character(data$Baths))
g <- lm(Price~.-Address-Baths,data)
summary(g)
