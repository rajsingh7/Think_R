# Why R ?
Ryan Zhang  

## R Programming Language
+ Statistical programming language
+ Open source, free 
+ nice plots (go check out ggplot gallery)
+ reproducibility (R markdown, all my docs today)
+ lots of packages (DOTA2 analytics!)
+ can work on top of RDBMS/Hadoop (RSpark is here!)
+ can work with GPU! (GPU? not just gaming)

## Why Bother Anyway?
+ Mingfei says: "Learn SAS, we bentley is a SAS community."
+ Only MA611, MA710 and the Intro Data Science(Course code not decided yet) uses R
+ "... have to be seen to be believed." -- Donald Knuth
+ See my use cases, and the rest is up to U

## Use R as
+ Statistical analysis software - ST625 example
+ Application developing tool   - Bentley On Campus Job Posted
+ Data Mining/Machine Learning  - Kaggle Titanic
+ Operation Research Solver     - MA610ish example

## My thoughts on this group
+ Best way to Learn
+ DO
+ Best way to make sure you learned:
+ SHARE
+ DO + SHARE

## Now to the cases...
